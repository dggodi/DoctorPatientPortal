This project utilizes Java frameworks Hibernate and JSF.

The goal of this project is to allow patients to interact with their medical information and schedule appointments with their 
family doctor. Objectives are to automatically verify schedule appointment by request for open availability, rescheduling an 
appointment, and view a doctor’s note. The system will also manage appointment data, such as dates and times, for multiple 
doctors. DPP is meant to benefit both patients and medical providers by increasing efficiency and productivity.

The scope of this project includes the initiation and edit patient’s record, utilizing database for local physician’s office, send 
doctors notes and integrated messages for appointment reminders. Appointments scheduled by patients or staff will be 
managed by an automated management system for multiple doctors that belong to the physician’s office. Patients will also be 
allowed to edit their personal information. DPP also uses a secure username and password that prevents unauthorized 
access to patients records.

DPP cannot be used for multiple locations; patent can only view their appointments, profile, doctors notes, and integrated 
messages. A Patient can reschedule appointments and edit their personal profile. A staff member can only create and edit 
customer’s information, view patients record and send doctors notes. The automated management system can only manage 
appoints for that location.

DPP is meant to benefit both patients and medical providers by increasing efficiency and productivity. Patients can schedule 
appointments at their leisure which will help increase the productivity of appointments that can be scheduled throughout 
the day.
